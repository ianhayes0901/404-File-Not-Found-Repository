# 404-File-Not-Found-Repository
Group Repository for Team 404 File Not Found in Computer Networking 

# NOTE: For group presentation, file used was Project_All_In(Backup) copied over 3 different user files. 

## Breakdown of files: 
  ### -AppAttempt (both 1/2): Same code across both. Original try at making the app function, swapped over to Project_All_In during the timecruch. 
  ### -main.py: Created by Zora, an attempt to create a GUI for the app based off of the AppAttempt Framework 
  ### -Project_All_In (1,2,3,4, Backup): Files with names ending in 1-4 have experimental functions that were in the progress of being tested before being         abandoned in favor of using/demonstrating only what we had fully working. As such, and as stated above, Project_All_In(Backup) is the file that             represents our efforts and is what was demonstrated during in-class presentations. 
  ### -AliceInWonderland.txt: File borrowed from one of the lab assignments to be used as the file transfer test dummy. Capable of being used to  demonstrate that files of larger sizes can be transferred.
